The fluorescence characteristics of Fluo 3 were that it was visible light with excitation wavelength of 508nm, fluorescence wavelength of 527nm. The bonding of Ca2+ increases the fluorescence intensity of Fluo 3 as much as 40 times. Furthermore, since this substance is free acid it dissolves in alkaline solution when regulating the sample solution. (Excerpted from Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc. HP and translated)<br>

*Ionomycin is antibiotics (from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd.)<br>
It functions as Ionophore and has antibacterial activity to gram-positive bacteria. Often bonds with divalent cation and utilized to compulsorily inflow into cells (Ion selectivity is as follows: Ca2+>Mg2+>>Sr2+=Ba2+). It has high affinity towards Ca2+　but cannot bond under pH-value of 7. Also used in Bio membrane transportation experiments of Ca2+ and has similar properties with A23187.<br>

          <h3>Procedure</h3>
          <h4><b>1. Preparation of solutions</b><h4>
              <h4>
              As continuous oil phase, a solution of liquid paraffin and squalene was used. The ratio of volume of liquid paraffin to squalene was 1:1 and was prepared 5ml in total. Using high viscosity liquid paraffin stabilizes the droplets and mixing it with squalene that has relatively high viscosity makes the experiment proceed smoothly. Then 3.5mg(0.1 wt%) of SDS and 98.22mg (3wt%) of Span80, which is a surfactant was added. Because SDS is solid and difficult to dissolve completely, the solution was warmed to 90 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes. The presence of SDS enhanced the dispensability of the water droplet in oil (This solution was named solution A).
              <br><br>
              As water phase, two types of solutions in different conditions were prepared. For the first solution 9mg of glucose was dissolved in pure water. In addition, EDTA and Fluo 3 was added and adjusted so that the concentration of each was 0.2 nM and 4.0μM (This was named solution B1). For the second solution, 27 μl of 1.5M glucose solution mixed with 400 μl of FMC, which was washed with sodium hydroxide was prepared (This was named solution B2).
              <br><br>
              When preparing the water phase FMS has to be calcified. FMC is fluorescence bead that has carboxyl group and was prepared as sodium compound. The functional was changed into carboxyl group by immersing the compound into dilute hydrochloric acid. Consequently, this is reacted with calcium hydroxide (neutralized with strong basic) and fluorescence bead with some carboxyl group that has been calcified is generated. The generated compound was then rinsed several times to wash off calcium ion that was not bonded with carboxyl group.
              <br><br>
          </h4></p>
              
              <h4><b>2. Saturate continuous oil phase with water</b><h4>
                  <h4>
                      The continuous oil phase was saturated with water by letting solution to be in contact with water at a volume ratio of 9:1 (oil phase:water=5.0ml:0.56ml), for 30 minutes. The continuous oil phase is saturated with water in advance in order to remove soluble impurities. This also avoids solution B1 and B2 from seeping into the continuous oil phase and affecting the fluorescence intensity observation at the end. Then, the supernatant continuous oil phase was removed and distributed 1 ml each into two micro-tubes, followed by centrifugation (5000 rpm for 8 min with a centrifugal separator). The supernatant solution was removed and used as continuous phase (named solution A).
                      <br><br>

                  <h4><b>3. Formation of W/O Emulsion by SPG pumping connector</b><h4>
                      <h4>
                          Solution A and B1 was each inserted into two pistons at the volume ratio of 4 : 1 (=600 μl : 150μl in our experiment ) and connected using SPG pin pong connecter. The piston of the continuous oil phase was pushed towards the water phase in order to coat the SPG porous surface of the SPQ ping-pong connecter with the oil phase. In this way, water phase was forced through porous medium into continuous oil phase and the water phase was dispersed. Through the process, the size of water droplet became almost the same as the tunnel in the SPG pumping connector, which was about 20μm. W/O emulsion was formed (named solution C1).<br><br>
                          
                          
                          
                          The same procedure was also conducted on solution A and B2. (The resulting emulsion was named solution C2). At this point, there should be two types of E/O emulsion (at the volume ratio of oil : water = 4:1).<br><br>

                          <h4>
                              Firstly, solution C1 and C2 was mixed at the volume ratio of 1:1. Then two samples, one to mix wt0.1% ionomycin and the other for wt0.02%, were prepared, extracted 100μl each. Two additional samples for both made by mixing C1 and wt0.1 ionomycin and C1 and wt0.02% ionomycin were prepared as a contrast experiment (The solution was named D1, D2, D3 and D4).<br><br></h4></p>
                          
                          <h4><b>5. Observation</b><h4>
                              <h4>
                                  Solution D1 ~ D4 was observed one hour after mixing and one day after mixing. When observing, solution D was diluted to 100fold by A so that the total water volume was mixed together at the rate of water to oil = 1:400.<br><br>
