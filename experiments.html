          <h3>Procedure</h3>
          <h4><b>1. Preparation of solutions</b><h4>
              <h4>
              As continuous oil phase, a solution of liquid paraffin and squalene was used. The volume ratio of liquid paraffin to squalene was 1:1 and was prepared 5ml in total. Using high viscosity liquid paraffin stabilizes the droplets and mixing it with squalene that has relatively high viscosity makes the experiment proceed smoothly. Then 3.5mg (0.1 wt%) of SDS and 98.22mg (3wt%) of span80, which is a surfactant, were added. Because SDS is solid and it was difficult to dissolve it completely, the solution was warmed to 90 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes. The presence of SDS enhanced the dispensability of water droplets in oil (this solution was named solution A).
              <br><br>
              As water phase, two solutions in different conditions were prepared. For the first solution, 9mg of glucose was dissolved in pure water. In addition, EDTA and fluo3 were added and adjusted so that the concentration of each was 0.2 nM and 4.0μM (this was named solution B1). The reason why we used EDTA was clarifying that no calcium ions existed in solution B1. For the second solution, 27μl of 1.5M glucose solution mixed with 400μl of the 10wt% FMC (Fluoresbrite Carboxylate Microspheres) solution, which was washed with sodium hydroxide was prepared (this was named solution B2).
              <br><br>
              When preparing the water phase, FMS had to be calcified. Fluorescence beads in the FMC solution have carboxyl group and were provided as sodium compound. The compound was then immersed into dilute hydrochloric acid to separate carboxyl group and sodium. Consequently, it was reacted with calcium hydroxide neutralized with strong basic to generate fluorescence beads with calcified carboxyl group. The generated compound was then rinsed several times to wash off calcium ions that were not bonded with carboxyl group.
              <br><br>
          </h4></p>
              
              <h4><b>2. Saturate continuous oil phase with water</b><h4>
                  <h4>
                      Solution A was saturated with water by letting solution A be in contact with water at a volume ratio of 9:1 (solution A:water=5.0ml:0.56ml) for 30 minutes. Solution A was saturated with water in advance in order to remove soluble impurities. (This avoids solution B1 and B2 from seeping into the continuous oil phase and affecting the fluorescence intensity observation at the end.) Then, the supernatant continuous oil phase was removed and distributed 1ml each into two micro-tubes, followed by centrifugation (5000rpm for 8min with a centrifugal separator). The supernatant solution was removed and used as continuous phase (the resulting solution was also named solution A).

                      <h4>
                          Solutions A and B1 were each inserted into two syringes at the volume ratio of 4:1 (=600 μl:150μl in our experiment) and connected using the SPG pumping connector. The syringe of solution A was pushed towards solution B1 in order to coat the SPG porous surface of the SPQ pumping connector with solution A. In this way, solution B1 was forced through porous medium into solution A and solution B1 was dispersed. Through the process, the size of water droplets became almost the same as that of tunnels in the SPG pumping connector, which was about 2μm. Thus W/O emulsion was formed (named solution C1).<br><br>

                  <h4>The SPG (Shirasu Porous Glass) pumping connector is a device to make monodispersed W/O emulsion, in which droplets are uniform in size. Two kinds of SPG pumping connectors were prepared. The diameter of tunnels in one SPG pumping connector was 10μm and that of the other was 20μm. Although it is easier to observe bigger water droplets, it is more difficult for them to remain stable in general. To decide which SPG pumping connector to use in the main experiment, the stability of differently sized droplets was observed.

                      From the results of the observation of W/O emulsion, the following conclusions were obtained.<br>
                      ・Droplets produced by the connector with 20μm tunnels were stable enough to exist.<br>
                      ・By procedure 3, the diameter of droplets became certainly uniform.<br>
                      ・With more pumping, the proportion of smaller droplets became high.<br>
                      <br>
                      Considering these results, we decided to use the SPG pumping connector with 20μm tunnels and to pump 5 times in the main experiment.<br><br>
                  
                  From these pictures, it was found that the density of droplets was too high and that it was important to search for proper density of droplets for observation.

                <h4>
                As the ratio of water phase to continuous phase changes, the density of droplets changes and the difficulty of observation also changes. For more efficient observation, four conditions of dilution were tested.<br><br>
                
                In this experiment, materials and procedures were almost the same as preliminary experiment 1. Only the degree of dilution before observation was different. After pumping, W/O emulsion was diluted with continuous phase to the degree that the ratio of water phase to continuous phase was 30:1, 100:1 and 1000:1.<br><br>

                <h4>
                    By observing W/O emulsion in these conditions, it was understood that the condition (water phase:continuous oil phase = 1:100~1000) was proper for observation.<br><br>
                <h4><b>3. Investigating the effect of Tris-HCl buffer to the stability of W/O emulsion </b></h4>
                
                <h4>
                Tris-HCl buffer was used as water phase in the experiment by Sugiura. On the other hand, in our main experiment, Tris-HCl buffer was not proper because producing the difference of pH was important. To confirm whether W/O emulsion remains stable without buffer, and if not, to reconsider the conditions of the main experiment, we took place the following experiment.<br>
                As continuous oil phase, the same volume of liquid paraffin and squalen were mixed and 3wt% span80 and 0.1wt% SA were added. As water phase, the following solutions were used.<br>
                A） Tris-HCl buffer (pH9, 50mM)<br>
                B)　Water with glucose (10mM) (No electrically charged particles exist. The concentration of particles in the solution was the same as that of 50mM Tris-HCl buffer)<br>
                C)　Water<br><br>
                
                In solution A), stable W/O emulsion was observed. In other words, droplets repel each other and did not make clusters. In solutions B) and C), droplets were stuck together and many clusters were made. Thus, it became clear that in order for droplets to repel each other the existence of buffer was essential.<br><br>
                
                In this system, SA, which is a kind of amine, is the cause of repulsion between droplets and that of stability of W/O emulsion because amine is bound with a proton (H+ ion) ion in the solution and gets positive charge. It forms a part of the membrane of water droplets. Then, droplets get positive charge and repel each other.<br><br>
                
                From the above consideration, it became clear that in order for SA to work, providing SA with protons in the solution was essential. However, Tris-HCl buffer is not proper for the main experiment. Therefore, another kind of surfactant which causes repulsion between water droplets without ion interchange was needed.<br><br>
                
                Then, it occurred to us to use SDS instead of SA. SDS is surfactant made from strong acid and strong base, so SDS easily ionizes in water. Thus, it was expected to cause repulsion between water droplets in continuous oil phase.<br><br>
                
                When SDS was used as continuous oil phase in place of SA and solutions B) and C) were used as water phase, stable W/O emulsion with water droplets which repel each other was made.<br><br>
                
                Comparing solutions B) and C), solution B) is more similar to solution A) in the concentration of particles. So we decided to use SDS as surfactant and water with 10mM glucose as water phase in the main experiment.
